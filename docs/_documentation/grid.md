Concrete uses [Grid50](http://grid50.com). The markup classes are similar to that of bootstrap, it uses `containers` , `row`s and `column`s. It's important to remember that these elements don't necessarily need to be nested with in each other. There is some useful examples below of how these classes can be used. If you follow the simple principles below there should be no reason to modify the grid, just the provided variables.

Below is a simple introduction to Grid50, but be sure to checkout the [Grid50 documentation](http://grid50.com).
