Concrete is a lightweight framework for Shopify. It has everything you need and some extras that you want all of the time. We have tried to keep Concrete as lightweight as possible and not impose styling choices upon you that take a lot of time to overwrite. Therefore Concrete's CSS framework gives you a lovely grid to work with, some css resets to make your theme look the same across as many browsers as possible, defines some common variables and some mixins that will make development faster.

If you're developing a theme using slate then you will be happy to see that all of the CSS and Javascript has been separated into modular chunks. This way you can easily extend Concrete without modifying the core of the framework.

### MIT License

We have put a lot of time and effort into Concrete and we will be continuing to do so. It is available under the MIT license which in short means that you can do whatever you like to it, so long as you maintain the original license and **leave all credits and their original location**.
