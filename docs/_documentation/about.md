Concrete is a lightweight framework for Shopify. It has everything you need and some extras that you want all of the time. We have tried to keep Concrete as lightweight as possible and not impose styling choices upon you that take a lot of time to overwrite. Therefore Concrete CSS framework gives you a lovely grid to work with, some css resets to make your theme look the same across as many browsers as possible, defines some common variables and some mixins that will make development faster.

If you're developing a theme using slate then you will be happy to css that all of the CSS and Javascript has ben separated into modular chunks. This way you can easily extend Concrete without modifying the core of the framework.
