# Concrete

A minimal boilerplate for rapid development of Shopify theme. Built using Shopify Starter Theme & Slate v1.

@elkfox/grid layout system & helpers have been included to make getting started super easy.

## FAQ

Q. Why is it ugly?

A. This is designed to be a simple starting point for your themes. You should create your own styling methodology.

A. The demo store is running an old version (at time of writing, 2018/02/12)

Q. Is the old Concrete still available?

A Yep! It's on [this branch](https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete/tree/slate_0)

Q. Where is the documentation?

A You can see the old documentation [here](https://elkfox.github.io/Concrete/). This is yet to be updated for the Slate v1 version (at time of writing, 2018/02/12)

## Inclusions

- Micro cart (to be replaced by @elkfox/cart)

## Starter Theme

> **Starter Theme and [Slate v1](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) are currently in beta!** You should expect potentially breaking changes between updates and more bugs than a finalized release. Slate v1.0 has not yet been tested on Windows.

Starter Theme represents the Shopify Themes Team's opinionated starting point for new Slate theme projects. It strives to include up-to-date best practices and solutions that we have deemed needed for the majority of themes we build. It is a reflection of what’s possible when building a theme!

The JavaScript files contain most of Shopify's [helper scripts](https://github.com/Shopify/theme-scripts/tree/master/packages) and [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) for responsive image lazy loading.

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with Starter theme:

- **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- **NPM 5+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have [ups and downs](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/), choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions [for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to make sure you're using the latest version.

## Getting started

To get started with Concrete, run the following command in your terminal:

<s>$ yarn create slate-theme my-new-theme</s>

For more information on connecting your new project with a Shopify store, see the [Slate docs](https://github.com/Shopify/slate/wiki/3.-Connect-to-your-store).
