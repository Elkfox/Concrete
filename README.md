# Concrete

Concrete Shopify Theme Framework - A lightweight framework for building Shopify themes

Concrete has recently been rebuilt using [slate](https://shopify.github.io/slate/) so the current release is currently unstable. We are working towards a full stable release and documentation too. In the mean time feel free to raise any issues.

### Getting started

#### Manually

To get started with Concrete, you can download the zip file from the [upload directory](https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete/tree/master/upload) of this repo. 

Then you can upload to the [Themes section of your Online Store](https://www.shopify.com/admin/themes)

#### Using [Shopify Theme Kit](https://shopify.github.io/themekit/) 

`theme bootstrap --password=[api-password] --store=[your-store.myshopify.com] --url=https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete/raw/master/upload/Concrete.zip`

#### Using [Shopify Slate](https://shopify.github.io/slate/)

Coming soon...
